# Simple-2D-Space-Shooter-Game-Using-Pygame
## Overview
This project is a simple 2D space shooter game built using the Pygame library in Python. Players control two spaceships (one red and one yellow) and attempt to shoot each other while avoiding taking damage. The game features movement controls, shooting mechanics, and health tracking, with sound effects for shooting and collisions.

## Features
Game Window: A window of size 900x500 pixels where the game takes place.
